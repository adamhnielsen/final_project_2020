# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->

## Material

## Procedure

## Data analysis
We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.

```{r Outliers check, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, include=FALSE} 
names(raw_data)
raw_data %>% 
  mutate_if(is.integer, as.numeric) %>% #never seen several of these functions
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%             #is.integer, as.numeric, mutate_if(), gather()
  gather() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
    facet_wrap(~ key, scales = "free") +
    geom_boxplot()+
    theme_minimal()

# This is a great chunk of code. Very nice.

dim(raw_data)


#final data to be used
data = raw_data %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c(race,engnat,hand,source)) %>%  #retain only those columns required for the analysis
  filter(country=="US",age >18 & age<= 80) #Use ONLY US cases, and age between 18 and 80 years

describe(data)

  
```

```{r Parallel Analysis, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

paran(data[,4:53], iterations = 500, quietly = F, 
    status = FALSE, all = FALSE, cfa = FALSE, graph = TRUE, color = TRUE, 
    col = c("black", "orange", "skyblue"), lty = c(1, 2, 3), lwd = 1, legend = TRUE,
    file = "", width = 200, height = 200, grdevice = "png", seed = 0)

```

```{r Rotations, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  ##Varimax rotation
R.var = principal(data[,4:53], nfactors = 7, rotate = "varimax", normalize = T) #Kaiser normalization will be applied
raw_var = fa.sort(R.var)
df_var = data.frame(unclass(raw_var$loadings))
write.xlsx(df_var, file = "Rotation outputs.xlsx", row.names = TRUE, sheetName = "varimax", append = FALSE)


df_var%>% 
  kable()

  ##Oblimin rotation
R.ob = principal(data[,4:53], nfactors = 7, rotate = "oblimin", normalize = T)
struc.mat = R.ob$loadings %*%R.ob$Phi #multiplying the pattern matrix with the covariance matrix from the rotated factors
df_obl = fa.sort(struc.mat)#Interpreting the Structure matrix
write.xlsx(df_obl, file = "Rotation outputs.xlsx", row.names = TRUE, sheetName = "oblimin", append = TRUE)

df_obl %>% 
  kable()

```


# Results
Parallel analysis suggested 7 factors to be retained. Seven factor solution was rotated using varimax and oblimin rotations.
